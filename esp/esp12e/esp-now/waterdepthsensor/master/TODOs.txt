- implement i2c or spi TFT code. used 1.8" st7735 instead. -- done
- check if the sensor is online on every 1min or so?
   esp_now_is_peer_exists() can be used? - not sure if it checks whether the
   peer is alive or not. need to test and verify -- not needed.
- i think we don't need to do that. we should have a timestamp of packets arrival from slaves and compare this with current time in main loop - implemented

- display on/off btn - maintain the state of display on and off in the code.
  and switch off display after 30s.
   - or add a PIR sensor instead? - Added btn instead at GPIO0 - done
  - Use connection Wifi icon for showing connectivity? - done
