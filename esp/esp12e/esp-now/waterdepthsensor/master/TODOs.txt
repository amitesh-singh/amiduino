- implement i2c or spi TFT code.
- check if the sensor is online on every 1min or so?
   esp_now_is_peer_exists() can be used? - not sure if it checks whether the
   peer is alive or not. need to test and verify
- i think we don't need to do that. we should have a timestamp of packets arrival from slaves and compare this with current time in main loop
