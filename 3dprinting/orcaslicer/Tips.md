# Tips

## numkaers PETG 

### do it before printing PETG

- it's hard to remove the purge line, before printing starts. put a glue on that area.

### mouse-ears

- Add mouse ears if the print area is too large, to avoid wrapping at the corners. 
  This might be required for PETG.
- Orca settings; it's under Brim type

### Brim 

- if mouse ears does not work, then it might be useful to use brim for a long height
print.
- Orca settings; it's under Brim type;

## PLA


## ASA 

- black ASA, bought from ASA.
### what did not work on texture PEI sheet

- ender 3v3 se can print ASA beautifully ;)
- no layer lines visible. layer lines are only visible when there is a wrapping
- tried printing without brim and enclosure, the simplest print which is tire valve cap did not print.. 
  
  major issue is bed adhesion and wrapping
    - tried with brim, and small footprint part like `tire valve cap` did print without any issues. No wrapping
- Tried to print the support for reverse bowden for SE and there were brim support and again, it did wrap at one corner. 
    - ambient temperature was around `33-35C` ; it wrapped again.

- next step: Try printing with glue and brim too
- try printing with smooth PEI sheet. with glue and brim.

## ABS

- better to use ASA as it's easier to print and offer same properties like ABS
with more UA resistance and generates less toxic fumes.
