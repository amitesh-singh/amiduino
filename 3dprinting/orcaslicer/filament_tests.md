- ![LA line test - orca slicer](image-3.png)

   By looking at the image, it seems that 0.062 is a sweet spot
   Saved this settings for wol3d red pro+ into orca slicer


### Retraction Test

This test is done to avoid stringing;
- it turned out to be great from 0.3 to 1.5; set it to `1.0` mm seems to be sweet spot

### tolerance test

- 0.2 seems to be fine; 0.25 gap will be sweet spot
- 0.3 seems to be loose
- 0.4 mm is ultra loose

### max volumentric speed

I reduced it to 12mm and it yearns better results.

### flow ration

reduced it to 0.96 from 0.98.. less overflow;
